    Why This Course
    <div class="answer">I'm taking this course mostly out of curiosity and a desire to learn. I took Introduction to JavaScript last semester and am eager to learn more about what happens on the server side of a web application.</div>

    Programming Experience
    <div class="answer">An older family friend taught me some C++ when I was 8 or 9. I took Turbo Pascal in high school, and in college took a few computer science classes (C++ and Python), but majored in English. Most recently I took Intro to JavaScript, which I loved. TL;DR: Breadth not depth.</div>
